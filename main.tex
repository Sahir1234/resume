    \employer{Software Development Engineer II}{Amazon}{December 2024 -- PRESENT}{}
    \smallskip
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
        \item Onboarded a new team of engineers by hosting technical deep dives, architecture reviews, and hands-on leading overviews
        \item Designed a scalable workflow to ensure AI-generated listings formed valid product families to maintain Catalog quality
        \item Partnered with Principal Engineers to align service design with immediate objectives and long-term architectural vision

    \employer{Software Development Engineer I}{Amazon}{August 2022 -- November 2024}{}
    \smallskip
	\begin{bullet-list-minor}
        \item Authored  documentation, operational runbooks, AWS CloudWatch dashboards, and test and launch strategies for a new microservice, enabling 6+ developers to onboard quickly and troubleshoot efficiently with Amazon internal tools
        \item Designed and implemented a Java-based experimental validator to generate curated detail pages for high-value Amazon sellers, protecting 5,000+ item families from catalog instability and reducing frequent product page changes by approximately 45\%
        \item Collaborated with Product Managers to clarify ambiguous requirements for the experimental validator and translated them into a comprehensive integration test suite, with appropriate metrics and SQL-queryable logs to monitor validator impact
        \item Investigated root cause of testing failures blocking cross-team deployments; led alignment across teams and transitioned tests from monolithic end-to-end to microservice contract testing by no-oping dependency calls, reducing failure rates by 50\%
        \item Contributed to the design review and implementation of an asynchronous cache update workflow using AWS SQS and ECS, setting up CloudWatch alarms, dashboards, and queryable logs to monitor system behavior and alert on traffic spikes
        \item Defined multi-year scope and coordinated parallel work streams for an AWS ECS service to reduce duplicated effort in seller listing experiences, collaborating with cross-team stakeholders on architecture, monitoring, and phased rollout
        \item Automated critical standard operating procedures by writing Python scripts to query multiple diagnostic tools via APIs and aggregate results, reducing on-call engineers’ average incident mitigation time from 1 hour to under 10 minutes
        \item Analyzed support ticket trends to identify/prioritize recurring issues, reducing team’s operational load by 30\% over 8 months
