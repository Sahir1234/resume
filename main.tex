    \employer{Software Development Engineer II}{Amazon}{December 2024 -- PRESENT}{}
    \smallskip
    \begin{bullet-list-minor}
        \item On-boarded a new team by hosting technical deep dives, architecture reviews, and hands-on tooling learning sessions
        \item Designed a scalable, extensible workflow to perform item relationship validations  during GenAI-based listing experiences
        \item Collaborated with Principal Engineers to ensure  design aligned with short-term objectives and long-term architectural goals

    \employer{Software Development Engineer I}{Amazon}{August 2022 -- November 2024}{}
    \smallskip
	\begin{bullet-list-minor}
        \item Designed and developed an experimental validator in Java to create curated detail pages for high-value Amazon sellers that protected 1,400+ item families from instability and reduced catalog churn for the initial selected selling partners by about 45\%
        \item Documented the validator's behavior for complex cases by writing a thorough integration test suite and adding queryable logs through SQL using AWS Athena to monitor its effects on Amazon's catalog, as well as metrics to track its performance
        \item Implemented an asynchronous workflow to update cache entries by receiving requests in an AWS SQS queue, process them in an AWS ECS service, and emit metrics to an AWS CloudWatch dashboard, with queryable logs to analyze traffic patterns
        \item Analyzed root causes of test suite failures blocking deployments across teams, and executed mitigation to no-op dependency calls and decouple test suites by testing service contracts rather than end-to-end, reducing test failure rates by over 50\%
        \item Automated team's standard operating procedures by writing Python scripts to query multiple databases/diagnostic tools and synthesize results, enabling on-call engineer to complete root cause analyses and mitigation of operational issues within minutes
        \item Acted as Operational Excellence Czar, tracking team support tickets, determining the common recurring root causes, and prioritizing project plans to resolve them permanently, reducing the average operational load of the team by roughly 30\%
        \item Authored detailed documentation, runbooks, test and launch strategies, and dashboards for a new service, enabling 6 other developers to quickly onboard to the project, collaborate effectively, and debug the service during on-call rotations
        \item Led my team's Kanban process, tracking productivity metrics and collaborating with team members to address pain points and facilitate knowledge sharing sessions to make sure the team understood long-term goals when making design decisions
