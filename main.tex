    \employer{Software Development Engineer}{Amazon}{August 2022 -- PRESENT}{}
	\begin{bullet-list-minor}
        \item Designed and developed an experimental validator to create curated detail pages for high-value Amazon sellers that protected 1,400+ item families from instability and reduced catalog churn for the initial selected selling partners by over 45\%
        \item Presented the experimental validator project to senior and principal engineers across Amazon, describing its behavior in complex cases and the implementation of queryable logs and dashboards to monitor the validator's effects on Amazon's catalog
        \item Engineered a Java API service hosted on AWS to enrich seller product submissions involving multiple package hierarchies
        \item Implemented comprehensive metrics reporting and error handling, and built/integrated clients for downstream system dependencies, resulting in a highly available service monitored in real-time and easily troubleshooted using AWS CloudWatch
        \item Authored comprehensive documentation, runbooks, test and launch strategies, and dashboards for the team's new API, enabling 6 other developers to quickly onboard to the project, collaborate effectively, and debug the service during on-call shifts
        \item Tracked the root causes of automated test suite failures blocking deployments across multiple teams over several months, and collaborated with product managers to outline, prioritize, and implement projects to reduce the test failure rates by over 50\%
        \item Wrote Python scripts to automate common SQL queries that are part of the team's standard operating procedures for identifying sources of transient and internal errors to enable faster root cause analysis and mitigation of high severity events
        \item Led the team's Kanban process, collaborating with team members to optimize workflows and facilitate knowledge sharing sessions to give developers more visibility into the team's larger goals and projects, as well as track productivity metrics 
        \item Served as the team's policy risk manager, identifying and mitigating over 70\% of long-standing violations within 3 months
